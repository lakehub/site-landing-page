## Quickstart-Guide

When you're working on your project immediately after having it in your
local repo, move to the root of the app.

NB: You should have ode and ruby installed in your system

1. Install node modules `node install`
2. The project uses compass so install the compass ruby gem `gem install compass`. This will land you in trouble if its not installed, grunt will keep throwing unexplained error
3. To start development run `grunt` from the project directory
4. Run `grunt publish` to get production ready code which will be in the dist
         directory
5. To see how the website will be in production `grunt publish` then run
         production server as `grunt server-dist`
